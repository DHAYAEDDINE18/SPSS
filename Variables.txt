When you open Variable View in SPSS, each row represents a variable, and each column is a property (parameter) of that variable.

Here’s a complete explanation 👇

---

### 1️⃣ Name

* What it is: The short identifier SPSS uses for the variable.
* Rules:

  * Must start with a letter.
  * No spaces (use `_` instead).
  * Max 64 characters.
* Example:
  `Q1_Gender`, `Age`, `Years_of_Experience`

✅ Tip: Choose short, clear, consistent names — e.g., `Q1_Gender`, `Q2_Experience`.

### 2️⃣ Type

* What it is: Defines the kind of data the variable holds.
* Common Types:

  | Type            | Description                | Example                     |
  | --------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------- |
  | Numeric         | Numbers only (most common) | 1, 2, 3 or 15.5             |
  | String          | Text values                | “Male”, “Female”, “Teacher” |
  | Date            | Date/time values           | 21/10/2025                  |
  | Dollar / Custom | Displayed as currency      | $1500                       |

✅ Tip:
→ Use Numeric for coded data (e.g., 1 = Male, 2 = Female).
→ Use String only if you don’t plan to analyse it numerically (e.g., names).

### 3️⃣ Width

* What it is: The maximum number of characters or digits allowed in a variable.
* Example:

  * Width 8 → allows up to 8 digits or letters.
  * If you enter “123456789”, it will be cut to “12345678”.

✅ Usually leave default (8) for numeric, increase for long strings.

---

### 4️⃣ Decimals

* What it is: How many decimal places to display for numeric data.
* Example:

  * `2.00` if Decimals = 2
  * `2` if Decimals = 0

✅ For whole-number codes (like gender, Likert scales), set Decimals = 0.

---

### 5️⃣ Label

* What it is: A long, descriptive name for your variable (can include spaces).
* Example:

  * Name: `Q1_Gender`
  * Label: “Participant’s Gender”

✅ Tip: The label appears in SPSS output tables — use it for clarity.

---

### 6️⃣ Values

* What it is: Defines what each numeric code means.
* Example:

  * 1 = Male
  * 2 = Female

✅ Use this for categorical or ordinal variables to make your output readable.
→ You can define multiple values (1=Low, 2=Medium, 3=High, etc.)

---

### 7️⃣ Missing

* What it is: Specifies which values should be treated as missing data.
* Example:

  * If you code “99” or “0” for missing answers → set them here so SPSS ignores them.

✅ Useful to keep incomplete responses from affecting your analysis.

---

### 8️⃣ Columns

* What it is: The display width of the variable column in *Data View*.
* Example:

  * Set to 8 or 10 to see full text; otherwise, it may appear truncated.

✅ Doesn’t affect analysis — only visual appearance.

---

### 9️⃣ Align

* What it is: Controls text alignment in Data View (Left, Centre, Right).
  ✅ Only affects appearance — not the analysis.

---

### 🔟 Measure

* What it is: The level of measurement (explained earlier):

  * Nominal → categories (e.g., Gender)
  * Ordinal → ranked (e.g., Satisfaction level)
  * Scale → numeric/continuous (e.g., Age, Test score)

✅ Important: SPSS uses this to determine which statistics and graphs to allow.

---

### 11️⃣ Role

* What it is: Defines how the variable is *used in analysis* (mainly in advanced modelling or automatic tools).
* Options:

  | Role      | Meaning                                       | Example             |
  | --------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
  | Input     | Predictor / Independent variable              | Years of Experience |
  | Target    | Dependent variable (what you predict)         | Satisfaction Score  |
  | Both      | Used as both                                  | Interaction Term    |
  | None      | Excluded from modelling                       | ID number           |
  | Partition | Used to split data (e.g., training/test sets) | Sample group        |
  | Split     | Used to separate cases                        | Gender              |

✅ For basic SPSS use, you can keep it set to “Input” or “None.”
